# Design

## UX

new user flow:

- answer basic / high level questions (one at a time and customized based on answers)
- sign up
- receive private answer link, and somehow surface other features:
  - see other question sets (grayed out based on No's from BASIC)
  - intersections, etc

second user flow:

- option 1: force answering before seeing shared answers
- option 2: reading their answers, prompt to answer and save

## Features

- user accounts
- saved questionnaires
- per-answer notes
- share answered questionnaires
- see intersection between 2+ specific people
- multiple distinct answer sets (to share to diff ppl)
- list of my answer sets 
  - what the answers are
  - edit. update or "save as new"
  - who i've shared access with
- delete or regenerate private link. (granular revoking with individual links?)
- answer sets that have been shared with me
- anonymous answer links?
- custom questions?

## Questions

- where do questions come from?
- what happens when we change questions
